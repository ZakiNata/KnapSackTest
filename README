Knapsack Problem 0-1

Definition
The Knapsack problem can be defined as follows: Imagine having a knapsack that can hold up to a maximum weight, we have a set of items that each item weight is known and for each item we have a known value, the goal is to select items from the set that their weight sum won’t exceed the maximum weight allowed in the knapsack while getting the maximum value possible.
To summarize, the problem can be defined as a linear programming problem such that we need to find the maximum value by selecting items without exceeding the maximum capacity

Algorithms
In order to solve the problem, we have different algorithms that we can use, I’ve chosen 3 of them 
•	Brute Force
•	Dynamic Programming 
•	Linear Programming
